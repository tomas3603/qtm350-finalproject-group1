Broad Theme: Exploring the Relationship between Education Quality* and Productivity* in (we can compare several countries / regions) 
  Questions to Ask:
    Why? - ***political/economic institutions largely influence the level of education / output / tech, so we can take a look at countries that have recently reformed
           their public education sectors, or other things of the nature and see if we can identify an increase in education and/or output (gdp, gdp per capita)
    How can we identify countries with 'good' education systems?
      - some research on countries who've reformed education
      - ****look at countries with high schooling rates
      - compare nearby countries whose education systems are significantly different
      
      
***Use 'Why Nations Fail" as a baseline? - research which won nobel prize in econ this year, essentially attributes a countries success to how good their institutions are
      - we can sue this as evidence, or atleast a reason to explore education vs gdp and compare countries
  - countries with 'exclusive' education sectors vs 'inclusive'
    - cost of school? is there a public school system? 
    - look at gov expenditure in the education sector
    - look at compulsory schooling years required
    - "The low education level of poor countries is caused by economic
institutions that fail to create incentives for parents to educate their
children and by political institutions that fail to induce the
government to build, finance, and support schools and the wishes of
parents and children. The price these nations pay for low education of
their population and lack of inclusive markets is high" (93)

      - research which indicate increased expenditure on education (public and private) in developing countries, including Sub-Saharan Africa positively affects GDP per Capita
      
      African Countries which have reformed education recently:
        Niger, Mali, Senegal - https://sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu/research/religion-politics-educational-reform/#:~:text=Three%20Sahelian%20countries,be%20considered%20new%20hybrid%20systems.
          - could explore these and see if their GDPs have changed drastically
      
      Similarly, Central American countries who've reformed education:
        Nicaragua: https://borgenproject.org/reforming-education-in-nicaragua/#:~:text=Reforming%20education%20in%20Nicaragua%20has,in%20primary%20or%20secondary%20education.
          - reformed education in 2015
          "In 2017, the government redirected approximately 4% of the entire national GDP to MINED. The repairs that have been done since then directly benefit countless public schools,
          especially in terms of providing better study conditions to the many children that go to these.
          In 2020 alone there have been four reform initiatives focusing on infrastructure reconstruction, student hygiene and health, drug awareness
          and increasing disability awareness within school institutions and curriculum."
